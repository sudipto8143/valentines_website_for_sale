To use your own background image:

2.  **Rename/Name** your image file exactly: `bg-custom.jpg`.
3.  Go to `src/App.jsx` and look for the "Background Elements" section.
4.  **Uncomment** the line labeled "CUSTOM BACKGROUND" and **Comment out** the "Pinkish Red Dotted Background" line.

## 2. Custom Font
To use your own custom font (for the handwritten names/titles):
1.  Find your font file (`.ttf` format is required).
2.  **Rename** your font file to exactly: `custom-font.ttf`.
3.  **Replace** the existing file in `src/assets/fonts/custom-font.ttf` with yours.
    *   *Note: If you simply delete and paste, make sure the name matches exactly!*
4.  The new font will automatically appear!

## 3. Custom Music
